    <h1>About our university</h1>
   <p class="uni-head">UK students with an offer from the University of Cambridge are advised to wait for further information
         from the university. The university is working hard to minimize the impact on admissions and is 
         consulting with UCAS and other bodies, while waiting for further government advice.

        International students who must take an English-language test should check for updates on when IELTS 
        and TOEFL test centers will reopen.
        
        All offer holders are instructed to keep a log of any disruption they experience, so the university 
        can treat all candidates equitably. Students are not required to send this information now, but may be 
        asked to provide it in the future.
