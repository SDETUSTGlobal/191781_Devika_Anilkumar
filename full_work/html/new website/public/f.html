    <h1>Front End Developer</h1>
    <p>Front end development is mostly focused on what some may coin 
    the "client side" of development. Front end developers will be 
    engaged in analyzing code, design, and debugging applications 
    along with ensuring a seamless user experience.</p><p id="p1"> You manage what
     people first see in their browser. As a front end developer you 
     are responsible for the look, feel and ultimately design of the 
     site.</p>
     <p id="p3">Front end languages include HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While JQuery
      is going out of style (modern browsers can now do the same work,
    but much more quickly than jQuery), many legacy projects still use 
    JavaScript library, so don't be surprised to see it on a bootcamp's 
    curriculum. </p><p id="p4">You’ll also learn tons about responsive design along 
    with typography, layouts, grid system, and color theory. When 
    anticipating types of projects you’ll work on as a front end 
    developer, think creating and redesigning websites.</p><p id="p5"> In order to be 
    a front end developer (sometimes even called a Javascript developer) you do not need back end development skills. Sites created by front end developers won’t interact with information stored on a database in order to be functional. The content will be “fixed,” meaning 
     data will not be constantly uploaded. Small business owners and
      restaurants usually have great examples of static sites.</p>
