   <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The University of Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world
    and is regarded as one of the world's top five universities. The University is a member of the
    Russell Group, a network of research-led British universities; the Coimbra Group, an association of 
    leading European universities; the League of European Research Universities; and the International 
    Alliance of Research Universities. It is also considered part of the "Golden Triangle", a geographical 
    concentration of leading research universities.</p>
    <h1>Services for International Students</h1>
    <p>Colleges are the main point of contact for students, and vary in their orientation arrangements. 
    Alongside this, support is available from student societies and volunteer alumni groups, who run fresher
     parties throughout September to introduce students to each other and university life.</p>

    <p>The International Student Team runs an orientation program at the start of each academic year to offer 
    information about the university, plus offer the chance to meet other international students.</p>
